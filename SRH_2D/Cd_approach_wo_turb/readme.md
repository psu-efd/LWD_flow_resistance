This folder contains the simulation cases for the SRH-2D model with the drag approach and turbulence model is off. 

Note: In SRH-2D, when make the turbulence model to be laminar, the simulation will be unstable. Therefore, a very small turbulent model parameter is used ("ParabolicTurbulence 0.01").
