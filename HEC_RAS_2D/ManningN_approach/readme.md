This folder contains the simulation cases for the HEC-RAS 2D model with the ManningN approach. The script `run_all_calibrations.py` will run the HEC-RAS 2D case within the folder "RAS_Case" and save the results in the folder "calibration_results". Thus, the HEC-RAS 2D case should be copied from the proper folder to the "RAS_Case" folder. For example, if you want to calibrate the case with turbulence model, you should copy the case from the folder "RAS_Case_w_turb" to the "RAS_Case" folder, run the script `run_all_calibrations.py`, and copy the calibration results from the folder "calibration_results" to the folder "calibration_results_w_turb".
